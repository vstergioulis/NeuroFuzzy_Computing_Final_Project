In this folder we have the finalised form of the Project , with all the additions and code changes that happened in the semester .
#### The Dataset used is comprised of 10917 artciles (in reality 10915) which split into 17 level 1 categories and 109 level 2 categories.

The accuracy of our neural network (build with the word2vec skipgram model) reaches at its peak 80.5 % accuracy at the level 1 categories and 60 % at level 2 categories .

## THe only thing needed to make our model work perfectly is to split the dataset in folds , due to the article number imbalance in the dataset. Here the split is 60/20/20 as training , validation and testing .
